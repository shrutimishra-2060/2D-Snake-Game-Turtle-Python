# Turtle
“Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it!

You can use functions like turtle.forward(...) and turtle.left(...) which can move the turtle around.

Before you can use turtle, you have to import it. We recommend playing around with it in the interactive interpreter first, as there is an extra bit of work required to make it work from files. Just go to your terminal and type:

```sh
import turtle
```

#### About Game:
This project uses two mian turtles: one to draw the caterpillar and one to draw the leaves. The code places each new leaf at a random location. When the progrsasm detects that a leaf has been eaten, the variables storing the score, the speed of the caterpillar, and its length are increased. A funtion figures out if the caterpillar has moved outsdie the window, which would signal the end of the game.
