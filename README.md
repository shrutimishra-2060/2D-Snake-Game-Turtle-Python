# Turtle
“Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it!

You can use functions like turtle.forward(...) and turtle.left(...) which can move the turtle around.

Before you can use turtle, you have to import it. We recommend playing around with it in the interactive interpreter first, as there is an extra bit of work required to make it work from files. Just go to your terminal and type:

```sh
import turtle
```
